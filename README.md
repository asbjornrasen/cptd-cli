## **CryptoProtos Todo DSL and CPTD CLI**

To install CPTD DSL CLI on any computer, run in the terminal: pip install cptd  
After that, CPTD DSL CLI will be installed on your computer! (https://pypi.org/project/cptd/)  


### **🔧 What is CPTD CLI?**

**CPTD CLI** is a flexible command-line system and the primary tool for automating, extending, and managing the functions of the system.

It allows you to:

* manage tasks, events, and DSL files,
* **create your own commands and extensions**,
* **integrate commands with external tools** (scripts, APIs, Git, CI/CD),
* **share commands between users**,
* run commands both from a local directory and from centralized repositories.

🧠 **CPTD CLI is not just an interface — it is a full-fledged *operational shell***
It serves as a bridge between:

* **The CPTD DSL** — a structured text format for defining goals, projects, tasks, and events;
* **User Interfaces** (current and future) — graphical environments that use CLI as their core engine;
* **User and system commands** — extendable automation modules developed within the ecosystem;
* **External tools and scripts** — through launching, exporting, analysis, reporting, and automation.

📦 It’s not just a way to run a command in the terminal — it’s a **universal control layer** through which the user and the system exchange data, actions, and logic.
The CLI enables you to **not just execute code**, but to **orchestrate thinking, structure, and execution**, unifying the DSL, visual UI, and operational logic into a cohesive architecture.

### **🧩 Why CPTD CLI is Important and Unique**

#### ✅ **1. Flexibility and Extensibility**

* Every command is just a regular Python file with a defined interface.
* You can **create your own command in under 5 minutes**.
* Supports **automatic dependency installation**: the command declares what it needs.
* Commands are distributed with their own **manifest**: `name`, `description`, `author`, `version`, etc.
* All commands in the shared repository undergo strict security review.

#### ✅ **2. Centralized and Decentralized Modes**

* You can use local commands (`./commands/`) or connect to a **shared repository** where users exchange scripts and utilities.
* The system supports a standard format for distributed CLI command repositories.

#### ✅ **3. Empowerment for Admins and Users**

* Admins can write commands that:

  * analyze user activity,
  * generate reports and strategic plans,
  * check licenses and enforce security policies.
* Users can automate repetitive actions, create templates, plan workflows, and document their activities.

#### ✅ **4. Minimalism + Power**

* The CLI remains **lightweight** and **intuitive**: everything is stored in plain files.
* No internet, no heavy installations, no cloud dependency.
* Runs equally well on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.
* Fully **offline-capable**, secure, and suited for controlled environments.

CPTD-DSL is a high-level domain-specific language (HLD-DSL) that implements the Structured Task Declaration Model (STDM) for activity and goal management. It is designed for declarative representation of goals, subgoals, and operational units (tasks, habits, events) using a human-machine readable (HMR) syntax.

The language follows the principle of Semantic Lightweight Markup with Operational Context (SLMOC) and employs an Extensible Annotated Markup Language (EAML), which makes it simultaneously:
– suitable for manual editing and version control (VCS-compatible),
– compatible with CLI shells and visual UI interfaces,
– optimized for offline use and automated analysis.

Thus, CPTD-DSL serves as a universal solution for text-based GTD, striking a balance between machine formalizability and human readability.

CPTD-DSL is not just a tool. It is a new generation thinking environment.
It is the language of those who do not go with the flow, but build their own destiny.
Those who replace chaos with a system, laziness with a priority, forgetfulness with order.

It is a method for those who decide not just to live, but to set goals, comprehend and win.
Every day you do not just keep a file - you shape yourself, layer by layer, line by line.

CPTD-DSL is a declaration of personal evolution.
And if you write, then you are in the game......

### **Official Documentation: CPTD System**

### **1. Brief Definition**

**CPTD (CryptoProtos Task Definition / Compact Planning & Tracking DSL)** — is a minimalistic, universal text-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language) designed for planning, tracking, and analyzing progress on goals, projects, and tasks.

It's a tool for those who want to clearly see what needs to be done, when, and why. It replaces dozens of applications with a single file that the user fully controls, ensuring **control, clarity, and sustained progress**.

### **2. Philosophy and Key Principles**

CPTD is built on a foundation that ensures user autonomy, reliability, and complete control.

* **Autonomy and Reliability:** The system is independent of the internet, clouds, and third-party services. Your data is solely yours.
* **Plain Text:** All data is stored in human-readable `.txt` or `.md` files. This guarantees longevity and accessibility.
* **Local-First:** Data is stored locally. The system works offline, in any text editor (Obsidian, VS Code, Notepad) on any platform.
* **VCS-Compatible:** The format is ideal for Version Control Systems (Git), allowing tracking of changes and collaborative work.
* **Manual Control:** No hidden magic. You fully control the process, ensuring maximum flexibility and awareness.
* **Simplicity and Depth:** The minimalistic syntax is easy to learn, yet it allows for describing complex projects and interdependencies.

### **3. What CPTD Allows You to Do: Key Features**

The system provides a full set of tools for structured task management.

* **🧠 Mentally Unload and Focus**
    * **Clear Decomposition:** Any goal is broken down into a `goal → project → task` hierarchy. This eliminates uncertainty and helps understand the next concrete step to take.
    * **Prioritization:** The `pri:A/B/C/D` attribute allows you to instantly differentiate important from secondary and focus your attention.
* **🎯 Achieve Goals Through Clear Steps**
    * **Progress Tracking:** The `progress:3/5` parameter visually shows movement towards the goal, which maintains motivation.
    * **Dependencies:** The ability to specify `depends:on:<id>` allows building logical chains of tasks where one action follows another.
* **🗂 Build a Dynamic and Scalable System**
    * **Daily Logs:** Maintaining daily files (`YYYYMMDD_cptd.md`) creates a rhythm and allows for storing a detailed work history.
    * **Archiving:** Completed goals and projects are moved to an archive, which clears the workspace and helps focus on what's current.
* **🧩 Flexibly Account for Everything Important**
    * **Roles and Assignees:** You can specify who is responsible for a task (`role:owner`, `role:other,Marina`).
    * **Categorization:** Tags (`@work`, `@study`) allow easy filtering and grouping of tasks.
    * **Different Activity Types:** The system supports not only tasks (`task`) but also recurring habits (`habit`) and logging events (`event`).
* **📈 Automate and Analyze**
    * **Machine Readability:** The structured format can be parsed by scripts (e.g., in Python) to create reports, dashboards, diagrams, and integrate with other systems (ETL, CI/CD).
