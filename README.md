CryptoProtos Todo DSL

CPTD-DSL is a high-level domain-specific language (HLD-DSL) that implements the Structured Task Declaration Model (STDM) for activity and goal management. It is designed for declarative representation of goals, subgoals, and operational units (tasks, habits, events) using a human-machine readable (HMR) syntax.

The language follows the principle of Semantic Lightweight Markup with Operational Context (SLMOC) and employs an Extensible Annotated Markup Language (EAML), which makes it simultaneously:
– suitable for manual editing and version control (VCS-compatible),
– compatible with CLI shells and visual UI interfaces,
– optimized for offline use and automated analysis.

Thus, CPTD-DSL serves as a universal solution for text-based GTD, striking a balance between machine formalizability and human readability.
