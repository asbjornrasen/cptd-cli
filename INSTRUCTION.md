## Guide to Using the CPTD System

CPTD is a text-based system for managing goals, projects, and tasks. It helps you structure your plans, track progress, and maintain daily logs in simple `.md` files.

### 1. File Structure

It is recommended to store all files in a single folder, organized by year.

```
üìÅ 2025/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goals_cptd.md         ‚Üê general structure: goals, projects, tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive_cptd.md       ‚Üê archive of all completed goals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dictionary_cpdt.md    ‚Üê dictionary of all terms and parameters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-06-01.cptd.md    ‚Üê daily log file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-06-02.cptd.md    ‚Üê ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

---
For a task in the CPTD system, the general format is as follows:

```

[status][priority] depends_on:<TaskID> task:Task Name start:YYYYMMDD end:YYYYMMDD due:YYYYMMDD  place:Location method:Tool role:role,name tags:tag1,tag2 id:UniqueID

```

| Element            | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `depends_on:`      | ID of another task that this task depends on                          |
| `[status]`         | Task status:                                                          |
| `[]` ‚Äî active,     |                                                                       |
| `[X]` ‚Äî completed, |                                                                       |
| `[-]` ‚Äî paused,    |                                                                       |
| `[!]` ‚Äî canceled   |                                                                       |
| `[priority]`       | Task priority:                                                        |
| `A` ‚Äî urgent,      |                                                                       |
| `B` ‚Äî important,   |                                                                       |
| `C` ‚Äî desirable,   |                                                                       |
| `D` ‚Äî optional     |                                                                       |
| `task:`            | Description of the task (what needs to be done)                       |
| `start:`           | Start date of execution (format: `YYYYMMDD`)                          |
| `end:`             | Completion date (if the task is finished)                             |
| `due:`             | Deadline for completion                                               |
| `place:`           | Location of execution (e.g., office, home, online)                    |
| `method:`          | Method or tool used (e.g., anki, markdown, quizlet)                   |
| `role:`            | Who performs the task (e.g., `role:other,Ivan`)                       |
| `tags:`            | List of tags (e.g., `tags:work,urgent`) ‚Äî for filtering and analytics |
| `id:`              | Unique task identifier (e.g., `G001_P02_T05`)                         |


Where:
* `[status]` - indicates the state of the task (e.g., `[]` for active, `[X]` for completed, `[-]` for paused, `[!]` for canceled).
* `[priority]` - optional but recommended attribute, which can be `[A]` (urgent), `[B]` (important), `[C]` (desirable), `[D]` (optional).
* `task:` - keyword indicating that this is a task.
* `Task Name` - a brief description of the action.
* `start:YYYYMMDD` - task start date in `YYYYMMDD` format.
* `due:YYYYMMDD` - task deadline.
* `id:Unique ID` - a unique task identifier that should not be changed after creation. It is recommended to use the `Gxxx_Pxx_Txx` structure.
* `role:role,name` - indicates who is performing the task if it's not you (e.g., `role:other,Marina`).
* `depends:on:<DependencyID>` - indicates a dependency on another task by its ID.
* `method:method` - method or tool for completing the task (e.g., `method:anki`).
* `tags:tag1,tag2` - tags for filtering and sorting (e.g., `tags:focus,urgent`).

## üìå Rule:

> **If a task depends on another (`depends_on:`), then `depends_on:` must come before `task:`.**
> This emphasizes that the task cannot start until the other one is finished.

**Examples of tasks from the documentation:**

* Completed task with priority: `[X][A] task:eliminate sugar id:G001_P01_T01`.
* Active task with dates and ID: `[] [B] task:write May report start:2025-06-02 due:2025-06-02 id:G002_P01_T01`.
* Task with role and dependency specified: `[][C] task:attach form to report id:G002_P03_T02 depends:on:<G002_P03_T01>`.

This format ensures clarity and machine readability, allowing for easy task tracking and management.

### 2. The Main File: `goals_cptd.md`

This file is your control panel. Here, you describe all major goals and break them down into projects and specific tasks.

**Structure:**

- **goals:** ‚Äî A global objective (e.g., for a quarter or year).
- **project:** ‚Äî A part of a goal, a major block of work.
- **task:** ‚Äî A specific action that needs to be performed.

**Example:**


```
### [][A] goals:health id:G001 status:active progress:2/4

    [][A] project:nutrition id:G001_P01 progress:2/2
        [X][A] task:eliminate sugar id:G001_P01_T01
        [X][B] task:drink 2L of water per day id:G001_P01_T02
    [][B] project:sleep id:G001_P02 progress:0/2
        [][C] task:go to bed before 23:00 id:G001_P02_T01
        [][B] task:don't use phone after 22:00 id:G001_P02_T02

### [][B] goals:work id:G002 status:active progress:1/3
    [][A] project:reports id:G002_P01 progress:0/1
        [][] task:write May report id:G002_P01_T01
    [][B] project:clients id:G002_P02 progress:1/1
        [X][B] task:call new client id:G002_P02_T01
    [][A] project:accounting id:G002_P03 progress:0/2
        [][A] task:request tax form id:G002_P03_T01 role:other,Marina
        [][C] task:attach form to report id:G002_P03_T02 depends:on:<G002_P03_T01>
```

### 3. Daily Files: `YYYYMMDD_cptd.md`

Each day, you create a new file in the `YYYYMMDD_cptd.md` format where you log the tasks for the day.

**Working with Tasks:**

- **If a task is not completed**, it is moved to the next day. In the old file, it is marked as `[*]`, and an active copy `[]` is created in the new file.

**Example of `20250601_cptd.md` file:**


```

```

### 4. Archiving: `archive_cptd.md`

When a goal is fully achieved (all its projects and tasks are completed), it is moved from `goals_cptd.md` to `archive_cptd.md`. When archiving, the goal, projects, and tasks are removed from the main `goals_cptd.md` file.

**Archive Example:**



```
### [X][A] goals:health start:2025-06-03 due:2025-06-06 progress:4/4 id:G001

    [X][A] project:nutrition start:2025-06-03 due:2025-06-04 progress:2/2 id:G001_P01
        [X][A] task:eliminate sugar id:G001_P01_T01
        [X][B] task:drink 2L of water per day id:G001_P01_T02
    [X][] project:sleep start:2025-06-03 due:2025-06-06 progress:2/2 id:G001_P02
        [X][B] task:go to bed before 23:00 id:G001_P02_T01
        [X][C] task:don't use phone after 22:00 id:G001_P02_T02
```

### 5. CPTD Dictionary of Terms

### 6. Recommendations for Maintaining Files

- **Structure:** Store all `.cptd.md` files in a separate directory, organized by year or project.
- **Identifiers (ID):** Use the `Gxxx_Pxx_Txx` structure. Do not change an ID after its creation.
- **Working with Tasks:** Do not delete tasks, even canceled ones‚Äîmark them with `[!]`.
- **Progress:** Manually update the `progress:x/y` field in `goals_cptd.md` when the status of tasks changes.
- **Syntax:** Maintain a consistent order of parameters (`status priority start_date task id deadline...`) for readability.
- **Dates:** Always use the `YYYYMMDD` format.
